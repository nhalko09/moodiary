# 📘 Moodiary

Moodiary is a personal mood journaling web application that lets users track their daily emotions, reflect on experiences, and grow emotionally. Whether you're feeling great or down, Moodiary is your safe digital space to understand what’s shaping your mood.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I created Moodiary as a simple but meaningful project to explore full CRUD functionality in Django while building a tool that promotes emotional wellness. Many people benefit from daily journaling, and I wanted to combine personal mental health with learning Django and PostgreSQL.
